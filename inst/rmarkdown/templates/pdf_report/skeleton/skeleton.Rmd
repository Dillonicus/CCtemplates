## Design
Present key elements of study design. Is it a retrospective or prospective study? Is it a cohort or case-control study? Are cases going to be matched? Etc.

## Primary Aim
State the primary aim of the study.

## Secondary Aims
State any secondary aims of the study.

## Planned Data Analysis
-	Define outcomes
-	Describe groupings
-	Describe all planned statistical analyses. 
-	You should describe methods that will be used to control for confounding or to examine and handle interactions
-	Describe how missing data will be handled
-	State what significance level will be used
-	State how multiple comparisons will be handled if applicable
-	Is there going to be an interim analysis and if so what will be done at that time
-	Mention what statistical package(s) will be used

## Sample Size Calculation/Power Analysis
-	Be clear of which aim(s) is/are being used for the power analysis. Is it based on the primary aim only?
-	List any key assumptions and include references for these
-	Clearly state chosen significance level and power
-	If loss-to-follow-up is expected, state if the sample size is going to be increased to account for this?
